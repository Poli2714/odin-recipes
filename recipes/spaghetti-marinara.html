    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Marinara (lit. 'sailor') sauce is a tomato sauce usually made with
      tomatoes, garlic, herbs, and onions. Variations include capers, olives,
      spices, and a dash of wine. Widely used in Italian-American cuisine, it is
      known as alla marinara in Italy, where it is typically made with tomatoes,
      basil, olive oil, garlic and oregano, but also sometimes olives, capers,
      and salted anchovies. It is used for spaghetti and vermicelli, but also
      with meat or fish.
